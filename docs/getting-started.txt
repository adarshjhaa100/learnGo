    go work sync : sync modules across workspaces


Language Concepts of Go:
    Workspace langspec has been created
    cd ./langspecs
    if creating a new module samplemod:
        mkdir samplemod && cd samplemod : create directory
        go mod init learn/samplemod : initialize the module
        cd .. && go work use ./samplemod : add the packages to workspace
